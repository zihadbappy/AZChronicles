                    <p><strong>4:24 AM, June 19, 2025:</strong></p>
                    <p>Ten minutes ago, I went out for Fazr prayer which was at 4.20 AM. Sad luck though. My bike lock wouldn’t work. The key to the lock doesn’t properly go in all the way sometimes, I don’t know what the problem is, but this is creating a lot of inconvenience in unexpected moments lately. So, in the dimmed light of Montclair city, my attempt to unlock my own bike felt like I am keying someone else’s bike to steal it. Frustrated, I came back up. I don’t know if I could still catch the jamaat if walked to the mosque which is 5-6 mins walking distance away.</p>
                    <p>It feels like the only good thing and connection to anything in this world that is left is my closing(hopefully) connection to Allah. Sure, I have an extraordinarily loving and caring family. Probably, my luck of friends is not as good as my luck of family, but I still have people in life who sometimes make me feel like I am not totally alone.</p>
                    <p>Despite all other good things in my life like- my job, having an own place with lots of freedom and privacy, and pursuing my dreams, it’s fair to say that I don’t feel any overcoming passion for any of these things. They’re mere conveniences at most. I struggle to find relaxation. I constantly keep finding myself with a mix of negative emotions because of what is going on around the world. I feel sad for the people that are suffering, guilty for being in a country that is participating in overwhelming oppression, I feel helpless for having no means to contribute and help the people who deserve all the good things. Experiencing all this often times, make me angry, but anger like that is not meaningful so I have to manage it. But, the issue remains. Even now, I am making this about me. I do not want to. And it is not about me. But, as I have the sense of compassion but no means to change anything, the only thing I end up doing is help myself. Which again, is selfish. But makes sense.</p>
                    <p>My goals of fitness has changed. I’ve started to find bulky people ugly. I am pretty sure I don’t want to bulk in the future, so that kinda make things easier for me. I want to have a lean athletic body. But, I want to be able to lift weight that is incredible for my weight category. I am somewhat satisfied with where I am right now at 5’9”, and 152lbs. I want to be able to lift more without triggering my back injury. I hate how my back keeps giving me a hard time. Anyway, I will have to make a fixed routing and get my days in order for my lifting ambitions and overall well-being.</p>
                    <p>Work is not interesting. I have helped the prof in writing a proposal for a new degree track in SWE. I’ve realized that I keep having communication issues with prof and a few other people in the dept. People in this country talk so fast. Like everything else, communication here is fast-paced too. It’s like they’re all running. Anyway, I am grateful to the prof for her goodwill, helping me with many things and covering me to keep the job in the dept, which I am sure she managed for me because she cares for me. It’s a support I wouldn’t have ever expected. However, I think I have had a bad coding test for GAship which was held on today. This bummed me out all day and will hurt me in the coming days. I am reluctant to blame myself for the poor performance because the format of the test was so random. I still hope I luck out inshallah.</p>
                    <p>I have reconnected with an old friend last week. We had a falling out but I finally swallowed my pride and reached out in an opportune time. Unplanned. That friend has been charitable and reciprocal. It felt good. I kept telling that friend about the extraordinarily dramatic, kinda sad, but very exciting life I have been living here (trauma dumping). But I have to be careful with people and the fact that probably no one will understand my experience with proper sensitivity and compassion it requires. Again, that’s expecting too much from people. So I will be careful.</p>
                    <p>There is something I can’t tell someone, or no human understands this- I feel like a bird who is stunned in shock be cause of a thousand tons of explosive that was dropped on it. It doesn’t know how it survived the explosion, but trying to recover and make way out of the remains of a tragedy, extremely hurt and in brutal numbing pain. This analogy doesn’t really make sense, but to me, it does. I have felt pain that is paralyzing in Feb-April. I would have given anything for it to stop hurting like my heart is being taken out of my flesh by a hawk. I am sure, a bird of prey dining on my heart would have hurt less. ofc this is all hyperbole, but the point is I could never understand how it is possible to be hurt that much. I couldn’t believe it. Still can’t. My belief system was shaken. Morale tanked. I kept finding myself zoning out so frequently because the pain would take over and numb all my senses, losing the track of time or surrounding. I am still having trouble making peace with a world where honesty and fair treatment towards people is taken advantage of and being gaslight for expecting the same fairness in return. I have never been able to accept the fact that lies and dishonesty is rewarded. This is a me problem I think. I see other people being pragmatic and living. But, something in me doesn’t want to let go of this idealistic view of expecting honesty and fairness and not be bullied . These things are easy to write down, but when I experienced it, I kept thinking that I am not a person who should be forced to live. It doesn’t make sense for someone as broken as me to go on about days. I will draw a conclusion about this here- I haven’t been able to forgive. I am accepting that now. I will be angry and disrespectful towards the wrongdoers and keep a resentment for them. As Mo Amer says, “Emotional Terrorist” doesn’t deserve any goodness.</p>
                    <p><strong>Other stuff:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I love Mo</li>
                        <li>I hate that when I am sick I get emotionally vulnerable too. I keep having these craving to care for people I loved before but does not deserve it. I can’t keep this loving side of me to not act up and miss someone.</li>
                        <li>My Quran lessons are the best things of my 2025. May Allah bless my teacher.</li>
                        <li>Montclair is an awesome city. I love riding bike and going places here.</li>
                        <li>Got my SSN.</li>
                        <li>Arab people make great food. God bless.</li>
                        <li>Really. I need to fix my sleep schedule. It’s 5.09 AM now.</li>
                        <li>So long before I last logged anything in journal. I constantly wanted to. But happening and busy days got in the way. There were so many incidents I would’ve like to write about, but I am sure I have forgotten by now.</li>
                        <li>I will never understand how someone can be so disingenous, hateful and evil but seemingly reasonable as Asmongold. It’s a shame. Hasan continues to be a force for good even though he messes up.</li>
                        <li>My issue with forgetting stuff still remains. Past month, I left my backpack in the mosque, in a restaurant, forgot to turn off stove while making tea and many more etc. I hope I can manage this well enough in the coming days.</li>
